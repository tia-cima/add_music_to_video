Just create a folder named "video" where put the video you want to operate. After, create two more folders, "temp_video" and "music", where put the background music. you can put multiple music files or operate with only one by changing the code. Create just one more folder, "NEW_VIDEO", where the manipulated videos with the new background music will be stored.
